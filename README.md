# microserviceproject
This project is more than just codeâ€”it's a demonstration of production-ready patterns, scalable infrastructure, and real-world resilience engineering. By combining multiple databases, service discovery, central config management, rate limiting, and testing frameworks, I've created a foundation suitable for cloud-native deployment and scaling.
