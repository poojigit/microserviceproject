# microserviceproject
This project is more than just code—it's a demonstration of production-ready patterns, scalable infrastructure, and real-world resilience engineering. By combining multiple databases, service discovery, central config management, rate limiting, and testing frameworks, I've created a foundation suitable for cloud-native deployment and scaling.


In my most recent project, I independently designed and implemented a microservices-based system using Java 17 and Spring Boot. I developed three independently deployable services using MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB — reflecting my comfort with polyglot persistence and domain-driven design. I built a full Spring Cloud suite including API Gateway, Eureka Server, centralized config server (hosted on GitHub), and integrated security via JWT.

I also implemented fault tolerance using Circuit Breaker patterns and Rate Limiting for reliability under load. This system was thoroughly tested using Postman and stress-tested using JMeter to simulate real-world traffic.

This project represents my ability to deliver clean, scalable, and production-ready solutions — and I'm eager to apply these skills to your backend development team.
